Gently pull on/twist the wires. They should not move at the solder joints.\n\nIf the wires move at the solder joints, use the soldering iron to reheat the joint. Make sure the wires and terminals (metal legs on the mono jack and limit switch) are both heated so solder connects them together.\nIssue: The LED is always on when the switch is plugged in.\n\nCheck if wires or solder are touching across the terminals of the mono jack and/or limit switch.\n\nIf wires are touching across terminals, you may trim excess wire.
